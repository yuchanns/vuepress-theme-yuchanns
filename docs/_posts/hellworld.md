# VuePress

*Vue-powered Static Site Generator*

<!-- more -->

## Simplicity First

Minimal setup with markdown-centered project structure helps you focus on writing.

## Vue-Powered

Enjoy the dev experience of Vue + webpack, use Vue components in markdown, and develop custom themes with Vue.

## Performant

VuePress generates pre-rendered static HTML for each page, and runs as an SPA once a page is loaded.

# As Easy as 1, 2, 3

```sh
# install
yarn global add vuepress
# OR npm install -g vuepress

# create a markdown file
echo '# Hello VuePress' > README.md

# start writing
vuepress dev

# build to static files
vuepress build
```

:::warning COMPATIBILITY NOTE
VuePress requires Node.js >= 8.6.
